# abnormality-detection-xrays
On this project we are going to use MURA dataset which consists of 40,895 musculoskeletal radiograph images from 14,982 studies, where each study is manually labeled by radiologists as either normal or abnormal. Our task is to build at least 2 deep learning models to perform abnormality detection per study on MURA dataset. The models which used for this classification task are: • 2D Convolution Neural Network (2 different architectures) • 169-Layer DenseNet Pretrained Convolutional Neural Network
